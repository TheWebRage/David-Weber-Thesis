Modern software systems can be complex, which can require more time dedicated to locating, isolating, and fixing faults. Even with a failing test, this process is tedious and time-consuming. Simplifying failing tests can significantly reduce the development effort by reducing the irrelevant program entities that developers observe. Delta Debugging (DD) algorithms automatically reduce the failing tests. Hierarchical Delta Debugging (HDD) algorithms improve DD for hierarchical tests like source code and HTML files. Many modern implementations of these algorithms work on a generic tree-like structure and fail to consider the complex structures and the interdependence of program elements of programming languages. We propose a tool, \mytool, to simplify C\# tests that uses language-specific features and the interdependence of C\# program elements using the Roslyn compiler APIs. We evaluate the tool on a set of 30 failing C\# tests to demonstrate its applicability and accuracy.
