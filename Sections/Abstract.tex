Testing software is used to gain confidence about various systems in a software architecture. However, since these architectures can get complex, making them difficult to debug and their tests equally as difficult and time-consuming. One method to reduce time needed for this process is to simplify these unit tests to fewer statements. Delta Debugging (DD) and Hierarchical Delta Debugging (HDD) are examples of algorithms that are used to simplify these tests. DD takes a failing test case and simplified it down to the needed statements for that failing test. HDD is an improvement on the DD algorithm that can work on tree-like structures and can simplify source code, markup language, and other tree structured files. We propose a tool, \mytool, used to simplify C\# tests that utilizes language-specific features and the interdependence of C\# program elements using the Roslyn compiler API. We evaluate this tool on 30 failing C\# tests and demonstrate its applicability and accuracy.
