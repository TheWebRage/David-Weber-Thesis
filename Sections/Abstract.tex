Modern software systems are complex and locating, isolating and fixing a fault even with a failing test is tedious and time-consuming. Simplifying failing test(s) can significantly reduce the developer effort by reducing the irrelevant program entities that developers need to observe. Delta Debugging (DD) algorithms automatically reduce the failing tests. Hierarchical Delta Debugging (HDD) algorithms improve DD for hierarchical tests like source code and HTML files. Many modern implementations of these algorithms work on a generic tree-like structure and fail to consider complex structures, intricacies, and interdependence of program elements of a particular programming
language. We propose a tool, \mytool, to simplify C\# tests that uses language-specific features and interdependence of C\# program elements using Roslyn compiler APIs. We evaluate the tool on a set of 30 failing C\# tests to demonstrate its applicability and accuracy.
